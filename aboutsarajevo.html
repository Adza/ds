					<p>Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, surrounded by the Olimpic mountains, placed in the valley of Miljacka river.
							It is the home of Nobel prize winners, Oscar winners, sports champions... It hosts world famous music, film and drama festivals, and welcomes all sorts of world renowned artists, from U2 to Milan's scale chorus. Being Bosnia's most important city, it has felt the full impact of Bosnia's century long reputation of being the point in Europe where East meets West. Because of this, the city is famous for its traditional religious diversity, with adherents of Islam, Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Judaism coexisiting there for centuries. </p>

							<p>A very famous and remembered event in the history of Sarajevo, and a significant date in modern history, is the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, marking the beginning of World War I. Possibly, the most important moment of Sarajevos time was the 1984 Winter Olympic Games. The history of modern Sarajevo begins with the declaration of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
							Apart from its rich history and culture, Sarajevo hosts a plethora of cafes, bars, pubs, clubs shopping centers and other interesting destinations where both young and old come to unwind, such as the various hookah (or nargile) bars.</p>

							<p>Meeting history and modern time you can see Sarajevos two face marks. Architecture from the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian period meeting the new growing buildings. Streets of the modern part mixing with the old part of town, the Islamic, Catholic and Jewish religious buildings and their sounds, different cultures, people and their mores all that and so much more colliding into one unique state of the art city.</p>
